## The Learning Problem

Sometimes, because we don't have any analytical solution to our problem we need to use data. Think about that is a tree? Do you need this information or just recognize one?

The metaphor we'll use for de Learning Problem will be Credit Approval. Let's imagine that a bank wants to know if a specific client is worth to borrow money from them. Let's name our componets.
- x user info (INPUT)
- f. X  -> Y: The target function, a function that predict if the customer will pay back the bank.
- D: Dataset (per (xn, yn)
- yn = f(xn) for n = 1, ..., N (number of inputs)
- g: X -> Y (function that aproximates f (Algorithm)
